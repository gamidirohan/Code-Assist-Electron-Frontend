# Conversational Co-Pilot - Floating Window

This project has been transformed from a screenshot-based Jiminy ‚Äì The Second Conscience to a clean floating conversational co-pilot application.

## What We've Done

### ‚úÖ Completed Changes

1. **Hidden Screenshot Functionality**
   - Screenshot queues are now hidden but kept functional in the background
   - Screenshot commands and UI elements are hidden from view
   - All backend screenshot functionality remains intact

2. **Added Floating Navigation Dock**
   - Beautiful animated floating dock with relevant co-pilot controls
   - Icons for Voice Input, Mute, AI Assistant, Conversations, Reset, and Settings
   - Smooth animations and hover effects
   - Positioned at the bottom center of the window

3. **Redesigned UI for Conversational Co-Pilot**
   - Clean, modern interface with glass-morphism design
   - Placeholder areas for:
     - MY SPEECH (voice input detection)
     - OTHER SPEECH (voice detection from others)
     - AI SUGGESTIONS (AI-generated suggestions)
     - AI RESPONSE AREA (where AI responses will appear)

4. **Updated Window Styling**
   - Added gradient background
   - Improved spacing and layout
   - Made the interface more suitable for a floating window

### üéõÔ∏è Controls

- **Ctrl+B** (Windows) or **Cmd+B** (Mac): Toggle window visibility
- **Floating Dock**: Navigation and controls (currently placeholders)

### üèóÔ∏è Next Steps (As per TASKS.md)

The foundation is now ready for implementing the actual conversational co-pilot features:

1. **Audio Capture Implementation**
   - Microphone audio capture
   - System audio loopback capture
   - Integration with Silero VAD for voice activity detection

2. **WebSocket Integration**
   - Connect to FastAPI backend
   - Real-time audio streaming
   - Bi-directional communication for transcripts and AI responses

3. **AI Integration**
   - Faster-Whisper for speech-to-text
   - DeepSeek LLM for AI responses
   - ChromaDB for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

4. **Real-time Features**
   - Live speech transcription
   - Question detection
   - Contextual AI suggestions
   - Streaming AI responses

### üé® Design Features

- **Glass-morphism UI**: Semi-transparent panels with backdrop blur
- **Floating Dock**: Animated navigation with smooth hover effects
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different window sizes
- **Dark Theme**: Modern dark interface suitable for a floating window

The application now provides a clean, professional floating window interface ready for conversational AI features while keeping all existing functionality intact in the background.
